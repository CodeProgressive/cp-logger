A tiny lightweight logger module used by many codeProgressive projects. The logger is designed to easily log on different levels such as; 'error' and 'warning'. It also gives the option to write the log to a file in a descent manner.

Right now, the module can be used by adding it as a module inside the node_modules directory.
In the near future we will post it on NPM so it can be installed using the following:
